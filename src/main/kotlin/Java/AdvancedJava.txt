Exceptions

The stack trace in the terminal. the red exceptions are in reverse order. Meaning the first one is the last method called the one
below that was called before it, and it goes down the stack.

The Java run time is looking for exception handlers, and goes down the stack of calls,
If it can't find a handler. It will throw an exception.

Types of Exceptions
    Checked / Unchecked / Errors

    Checked
        These are anticipated and should be handled properly.
        The compiler will force you to handle them, you will get a compiler error for checked exceptions.

        var reader = new FileReader("File.txt")
                            ^there will be a compiler error here
                                this is a checked exception, and you have to handle it the exception in a try/catch block

    Unchecked
        aka runTIme exceptions
        This would be a runtime exception, not checked by the compiler
        something like passing null to a method that it wasn't expecting your going to get and exception if you don't handle it
        these occur because of programming errors
        Null Pointer Exception is an example of that
        ArithmeticException
        IllegalArgumentException
        IndexOutOfBounds
        IllegalStateException

    Errors
        errors are external to our application
        stack overflow/out of memory errors something that comes from the jvm would be an error


Exception hierarchy
    goes off of class inheritance each one below is a class that throws exceptions for certain things
    Throwable -> Exception -> RuntimeException
    Error class inherits from the Throwable class.

Handling / Catching Exceptions and Multiple Exceptions

    Use try catch blocks

    public static void show() {
           FileReader reader = null;
        try {
            reader = new FileReader("File.txt")
            sout("File Opened")
            var read = reader.read()
            new SimpleDateFormat().parse()
        } catch (FileNotFoundException | ParseException ex) {
            sout("File not found")
            sout(ex.message())
        } catch(IOException ex) {
            sout("could note read file")
        } finally {
            if (reader != null) {
                reader.close
            } catch (IOException ex) {
                sout("Close Exception")
            }
        }
    }

    With this it starts out with the reader variable.
    the FileReader can throw an exception of FileNotFoundException.
    if it does it goes to the catch block where you can handle the exception instead of your program crashing.
    the "ex" you can use to dot into different methods to use like ex.message() which would print the exception message
    that it threw
    the "|" in the catch is the "or" it only has one because in Java the single pipe will evaluate both side of the "or"
    regardless if the value on the left side is true. (the "||" or if the value on the left is true, it just continues on
    and doesn't even look at the value on the right.)
    The reader.read() the read method can throw a IOException. so it has its own catch block. Because we want to have its own
    different handler. We could put theoretically all in one catch block but wouldn't have custom handling of each error.
    There is the class hierarchy, so we need to be cognisant of that. The more specific errors go first. If you don't you will
    get an error because the higher up class is already handling the error like the FileNotFoundException inherits from the
    IOException, so if that was first you would get an error if FileNotFoundException was second.
    it's already being handled by the first one.

    In the finally block it runs last. the close method there could throw an IOException, you would need to handle that
    in that block.

    try-with-resources
        public static void show2() {
            try(var reader = new FileReader("File.txt")) {
                sout("File Opened")
            } catch(IOException ex) {
                sout(ex.message())
            }
        }

        This is basically the same as above except in the try block the () is telling the compiler to run the close method
        if it doesn't throw an exception.
        It doesn't look MSL uses this at all. It uses the first example wit the finally block.

Re-throwing Exceptions

    You have a method defined in a class
    public class Account {
        public void deposit(float value) throws IOException {
            if(value <= 0) throw IOException();
        }
    }

    Then you are using it in another class or in another method in a class

    public class ExceptionDemo {
        public static void show3() throws IOException {
            var account = new Account() <- instance a new Account object

            try {
                account.deposit(-1)
            } catch (IOException ex) {
                sout("log the exception")
                throw ex; <- throw the exception again, because here the exception gets thrown, and we are just logging the output
                            we need to throw it again when the show3() method gets called;
            }
            }
        }

        The next this is calling the show3() method and handling it there. this would be the runtime on the app where
        basic and generic error messages would be.

        public class Main {
            public static void main {
                try {
                   ExceptionDemo.show3();
                } catch (Throwable ex) { <- can use Throwable here because IOException inherits is a subclass of it and show3() throws an IOException
                    sout("generic error message")
                }
                }
            }
        }

    If you rethrow an exception it will stop executing the method and will not do anymore try-catch in there.
