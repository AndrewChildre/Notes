suspending functions do not start coroutines
suspending functions are functions that can suspend coroutines
suspending functions are just like regular functions as in they run syncronously (within the asyncrounsouly ran coroutine
asynchronous coroutine builders launch and async
blocking coroutines runBlocking
coroutine scope functions coroutineScope withContext
cancel() only runs at suspension points
Dispatchers.Default have as many threads as cores on the machine
Dispatchers.IO for blocking operations uses a larger thread pool

Flow
flow{} works like sequence {}
only flow is suspending
