    Abstraction def
        sometimes a class doesn't represent a concrete thing, they may represent an "idea" in OO terms an abstraction
        the idea of a game is abstract, where the concrete/ implementation would be a soccer game.
        concrete things are represented by classes. Abstract things are represented by abstract classes.

        Abstract Classes

        Can't be instanced
        Kind of like an interface
            it's a placeholder where it provides a set of methods and properties that are partially defined
           -> other classes that inherit from abstract must implement all the abstract methods and abstract properties in
            the base abstract class.
        Can have constructors
        open by default meaning you can inherit from it without the open keyword.
        Remember to use the "override" keyword when implementing the abstract properties and methods

        Abstract methods don't have a body
        Can't be instanced, must be inherited and then overridden in the child class
        all about modeling what you want, and then implementing it somewhere else
        a val can be of type of abstract class. then you can implement a class that inherits from the abstract class
        that way the top level class is inherited from a bunch of subclasses, and you can implement any of them that inherits them

        abstract open by default
        abstract methods don't have a body
        abstract classes can't be instanced
