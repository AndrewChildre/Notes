    Abstract Classes
        Kind of like an interface
            it's a placeholder where it provides a set of methods and properties that are partially defined
            other classes that inherit from abstract must implement all the abstract methods and abstract properties in
            the base abstract class.
        Can have constructors
        open by default meaning you can inherit from it without the open keyword.

        Abstract methods don't have a body
        Can't be instanced must be inherited and then overridden in the child class
