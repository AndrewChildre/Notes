Kotlin Classes

    Classes are basic units in kotlin. Templates for creating objects

    They provide initial value for "state", meaning the class member variables and

    Implementation of "Behavior", meaning the class member functions/methods

    A Class is a collection of state and the behavior that works on the state

    A reasonable way to structure your code

    Classes are public by default

    In Java classes have to be in there own file, Kotlin can have many

    Use "." to access the properties of the object

    private modifier means they only have access to methods with in the class

    Encapsulate state and behavior


    Class properties

        define the state of an instance for an object/class

        val or var in the constructor makes them properties

        properties outside the constructor/ in the body of the class must be initialized

        If no val/var in the constructor you will not have access to it outside the class

        properties in the constructor can be initialized in an init {} block / the init is called after the values in the constructor are set

        methods in the class have access to properties of the class

        If you are not going to initialize a property use can use late init. but you have to make sure that you actually do it.

       class Properties are val/var
       class members are functions/methods within a class

    Class Methods
        define the behavior of an instance of an object
        methods have access to the properties of the class, i.e. they have access to the state
        When calling a method, it's passed a reference of the object we are calling the method on. And that is known as "this"
        it's a reference to the object were calling the method on
        To call the method you must first have an instance of the class
        the name of the variable is what is referencing the current object meaning this, and you're calling it through the variable name
        Methods/functions can call other methods within the same class

        the word "this" is referring to what is in the object not the parameters
        "this" meaning this objects values
