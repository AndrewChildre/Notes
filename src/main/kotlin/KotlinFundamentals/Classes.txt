Kotlin Classes

    Class properties
        val or var in the constructor makes them properties

        properties outside the constructor/ in the body of the class must be initialized

        If no val/var in the constructor you will not have access to it outside of the class

        properties in the constructor can be initialized in an init {} block / the init is called after the values in the constructor are set

        methods in the class have access to properties of the class

    Abstract
        can have constructors
        open by default meaning you can inherit from it without the open keyword.
        other classes that inherit from abstract must implement all the abstract methods and abstract properties in
        the base abstract class.
