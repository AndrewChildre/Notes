Kotlin Classes

    Class properties
        val or var in the constructor makes them properties

        properties outside the constructor/ in the body of the class must be initialized

        If no val/var in the constructor you will not have access to it outside the class

        properties in the constructor can be initialized in an init {} block / the init is called after the values in the constructor are set

        methods in the class have access to properties of the class

        If you are not going to initialize a property use can ust late init. but you have to make sure that you actually do it.

       class Properties are val/var
       class members are functions within a class
