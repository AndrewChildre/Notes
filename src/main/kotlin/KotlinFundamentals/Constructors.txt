Constructors
initializes data
 lets you initialize objects/classes into a known valid state
 lets you set properties with a value, can have a default in the constructor
 constructors only take data
 use val or var in the constructor
 they are values defined in the constructor
 they are the properties of the object
 if you use the "constructor" key word, you then can use modifiers
 class Person private constructor(val name: String) -> this would be to make the whole constructor private
 you can use modifiers on each property in the constructor if needed
 If it's private you can initialize the class, but won't have access to it outside the class
 you can use annotations for the constructors. for uses when you're using DI frameworks @Inject

 lateinit used in tests and when you want to define without making it nullable
