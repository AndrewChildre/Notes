Data Classes

Holds a set of data usually in the constructor and doesn't have logic.
it deals with the data in the object not the object itself
must have at least one constructor property val/var
has copy function to update the values in it. In the copy need to reassign it to get the new value the original stays the same
Modeling data without caring about the behavior.
getting data from something and modeling it to something else
If the property/value is declared outside the constructor it is not evaluated in the equality check

if you call a regular class and run the toString on it. it will print the object with the location.
when you use the "data" key word, it will print the class and the values in it
just used to model and store data.

can destructure like
val (name, id) = person the destructuring naming doesn't have to match the constructor parameters
if you don't want to use a certain just insert an underscore in that spot.

data class Person (
    val name: String,
    val age: Int
)

val andrew = Person("Andrew", 53)

destructured
 val andrew = Person("Andrew", 55)
 val (name, age) = andrew
 takes out the parameters in the data class, you can name them anything you want
