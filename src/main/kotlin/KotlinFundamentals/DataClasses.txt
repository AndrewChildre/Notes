Data Classes

Holds a set of data usually in the constructor and doesn't have logic.
it deals with the data in the object not the object itself
must have at least one constructor property val/var
has copy function to update the values in it. In the copy need to reassign it to get the new value the original stays the same
Modeling data without caring about the behavior.
getting data from something and modeling it to something else
If the property/value is declared outside the constructor it is not evaluated in the equality check

destructured
 val andrew = Person("Andrew", 55)
 val (name, age) = andrew
 takes out the parameters in the data class, you can name them anything you want
