Enums

they are constants the values don't change
most common use is with the "when" statement
enum class ErrorCodes(val error: Int) {
    NONE(0), UNK(400), LOST(743)
}
val errorCode = ErrorCodes.NONE

when (errorCode) {
    ErrorCodes.NONE -> "none"
    ErrorCodes.UNK -> "unknown"
    ErrorCodes.LOST -> "Lost"
}
when needs to have all the values handled, or it won't compile

has default properties
    name: what you named it
    ordinal: 0,1,2 like the index value
has default methods
    errorCode.values() will give you a list of values or errorCode.entries() is the same thing, you would need to loop over
    each of them to get a list of the values of each enum.
    errorCode.valueOf() <- can put the value of one of the enums in it.

    you can put an abstract method in the body fo the enum. the last enum needs a semicolon to that. then each enum
    will need to implement the abstract method within curly braces.

errorCode.name would be NONE
errorCode.ordinal would be 0 like an index

you can add a constructor to the enum class like above "error"
all the enums in the body would need to implement/add a value for that like above
