Extension Functions

    fun String.pad (numberToReplace: Int, replacementChar: Char = " "): String {
            val strToAdd = replacementChar.toString().repeat(numberToReplace)
                    return original + strToAdd
    }

    val original = "andrew"
    original.pad(5, '#')

    adding functions to a class you don't own
    makes code easier to read
    A "Receiver" is a value made implicitly(meaning it's implied to be there and available)
   "this" is the value/values of the receiver
   in the function above the receiver is "original"
