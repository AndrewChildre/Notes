Functions

regular function
    fun padding (original: String, numberToReplace: Int, replacementChar: Char = " "): String {
            val strToAdd = replacementChar.toString().repeat(numberToReplace)
                    return original + strToAdd
    }

    Default values in function use "=" then the value in the function definition, it's the common case. you can leave it
        as the or updated it when you call/use it.
    Named parameters
        are used in the function when calling it. You're just using the name of the parameter and an "="
        just to make it more clear. You don't have to pass them in the same order if you don't want to.
    Overloading a function is defining another function and adding or changing the parameters

    single expression functions
        use "=" instead of braces and doesn't need the "return" keyword
