Inheritance / Derivation

    The subclasses get the state and behavior of the base class
    we do this because we may want to add to the state or change the behavior in the subclass

    represents things
    represents a "isA" relationship in the classes
    Example below
    spaceBody -> planet -> habitable planet

    By default, classes in kotlin are closed "final" meaning that you can't inherit from them, unless you mark them as "open"

    FYI: In java it is the opposite classes and methods are open by default, and you have to final/seal/close them

    override keyword is letting you know that you are overriding something from the base class
    when using super keyword it's calling the base class and not the one above it. because the ones above it may have
    overrides as well

    One object acquires all the properties from the parent unless it's private in the base class
    If you want to override a method or property from the base class it needs to be marked as open. And you need to use the override
    keyword in the base class

    You can only inherit from a single base class
    you have to be careful when changing the base class it could break the classes that inherit from it or that are below it
    that's why you have to explicitly inherit for it

    when you are dealing with constructors you have to pass the values up if the Person class at the top has a val name: String
    property, and you inherit in the Student class the Student class needs to pass the name up to the Person class

    open in the top/base class, so we can inherit in the subclasses and override if needed in the subclass
    you can make something more visible in the sub-class but not less visible

    to call a base class method from the inheriting class you would need to use the "super" key word. like super.addPet()
    the super is calling up the stack to the base class to call that methods implementation. THats the same with properties
    within the class as well.
