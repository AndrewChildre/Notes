Inheritance / Derivation

    represents things
    represents a "isA" relationship
    Example below
    spaceBody -> planet -> habitable planet

    By default classes in kotlin are "final" meaning that you can't inherit from them, unless you mark them as "open"

    FYI: In java it is the opposite classes and methods are open by default and you have to final/seal/close them

    override keyword is letting you know that you are overriding something from the base class
    when using super keyword it's calling the base class and not the one above it. because the ones above it may have
    overrides as well

    One object acquires all the properties from the parent
