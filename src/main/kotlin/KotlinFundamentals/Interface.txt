Interface

    Can't have a constructor
    Used more than abstract
    implementing properties in an interface can be done in the class that is implementing it, or in the constructor
    Set of method definitions that we need to implement in some way
    classes that implement interfaces must implement all the methods that are not defined
    methods and properties are abstract by default
    if you happen to implement something in the interface it is open by default
    open meaning you can override it in a class that is implementing the interface
    -->classes have a "isA" relationship / where interfaces have a "hasA" relationship
    planet -> isA spaceBody / where planet hasA speedCalculator or hasA logger
