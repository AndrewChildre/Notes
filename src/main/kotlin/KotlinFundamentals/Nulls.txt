Nulls Notes
val name = "Andrew" or name = null if it's nullable

?. Safe call
    name?.length
    -> only use if you don't mind getting null
    if name is null the length function won't get called you will just get null

?: Elvis operator
    val nameLength = name?.length ?: -1
    it's like a turnary operator
    left side gets returned if not null
    right side if it is null

!! non-null assertion
    only use if you are sure it's not going to be null

.let {}
    val name: String? = "Kotlin"
    name?.let {
    println("The length of the name is ${it.length}")
    }

    .let will only run if name is not null

? after type makes it nullable and you have to handle it
