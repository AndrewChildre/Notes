Visibility Modifiers

    public -> is the default in kotlin all can have access, meaning all classes have access to the properties and methods of the class
    protected -> visible in the subclass from the parent class, but not another class
    internal -> visible within the same module
    private -> only visible and have access to within the same class

    for methods and properties
    you do it for encapsulation to allow access to only certain things with in the class
