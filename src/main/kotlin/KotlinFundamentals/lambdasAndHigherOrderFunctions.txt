Higher Order functions and lambdas

    A higher order function is a function that takes a function as a parameter

    Notes:
       to pass a function as an argument, you wrap it in curly braces in the function parameters
        below the action parameter is a type, that type is a function signature

        A lambda is always surrounded by curly braces, specifies parameters, and provides a body of the lambda which
        contains the actual logic
        { x: Int, y: Int -> x + y }

    Functions as arguments:
        fun foo(bar: Int, action: (Int)->Unit) {}

        fun someFunction(num: Int){} //Some function can be passed to foo because it matches the signature for it

        foo(23, { a -> someFunction(a) }) //when you pass a function as an argument, you wrap it in curly braces

        foo(23) { a -> someFunction(a) } if the function parameter is the last parameter you can move it outside the parens

        foo(23, {someFunction(it)}) you don't have to declare the variable like above, if it only has one. You can use "it"

        foo(23) {someFunction(it)} the compiler already knows what it is


       Can also do in-line code aka lambda
        foo(23, { a -> do something with a here })
        foo(23) {do something with "it" here}

        you can move the last parameter outside the () if it is a lambda

        if it's the only parameter you can lose the () on the function and just use  {}


  Function References/Scoping:
        fun foo(bar: Int, action: (Int)->Unit) {}

        class Bar {
            someOtherFunction() {}
        }
        fun someFunction(){}

        foo(23, ::someFunction) scoping operator this is at the top level, it's not in a class

        val b = Bar()
        foo(23, b::someOtherFunction) this is in the Bar class

        the below is the same
        people.maxByOrNull(Person::age)
        people.maxByOrNull {p: Person -> p.age }

    Fibonacci example:

        calling Fib:
            fibonacci(8,{ println(it)})
            fibonacci(8) { println(it)}
            fibonacci(8) {n -> println(n)} n here is the value getting passed to the println function
                    don't get confused here "it" is not 8 or the first parameter it is "current" coming out of the for loop where action is called
                    // the second parameter is the action function println doesn't return a value, but it's getting passed "current" which is an Int

            fun fibonacci(limit: Int, action: (Int) -> Unit) {
                var prev = 0
                var prevprev = 0
                var current = 1

                for (i in 1..limit) {
                    action(current)

                    var temp = current
                    prevprev = prev
                    prev = temp
                    current = prev + prevprev
                }
            }
    Line Logger function example:
        fun lineLogger(block: ()->{}){
        repeat(5){println("-------")
        block()
        println("done")
        }

    call lineLogger
            linelogger {
            println("message")
            }
            lineLogger is called here with a lambda....it does not need the perens when called because of the function parameter
            the curly braces is what calls the lambda it could be lineLogger({println("message")}) but it removes it for the kotlin language
