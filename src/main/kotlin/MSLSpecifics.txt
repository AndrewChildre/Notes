MSL Specifics

Normalizer:

Yaml labels are passed in the constructor of the class / they are auto wired by spring
Responses from the backend server are passed in as function arguments

BSC:

API Models: are the ones that interact with the backend using (moshi for the deserialization i think)
Client Models: are the ones that the API models get mapped to, and then we send to the feature side on msl.

AccountHub is the new one
AccountTab is the old one
